# AI-vs-Employment
This code was used to write my research paper about AI's effect on employment. It uses the amount of AI patents in each sector (NLP, ML, evolutionary, hardware) and evaluates it with employment in different sectors(management, engineering, service, and overall). With this information, the paper evaluates AI's effect on employment.
